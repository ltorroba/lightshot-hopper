# lightshot-hopper
If you are like me, you don't merely use Lightshot - you depend on it. You take
screenshots every day, be it to share progress in a project with your colleagues
or to record funny moments in a computer game.

Or to add that cat meme to your "Cute kitties" folder. Yes, we all know about that
folder.

Lightshot Hopper is an extension that allows you to quickly jump from the
default prntscr.com page, where your screenshot can be previewed, to the direct
link of the image, hosted on imgur. This allows you do avoid some annoying right
clicking.
