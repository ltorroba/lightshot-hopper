# lightshot-hopper
If you are like me, you don't merely use Lightshot - you depend on it. You take screenshots every day, be it 
to share progress in a project with your colleagues or to record funny moments in a computer game.

Or to add that cat meme to your "Cute kitties" folder. Yes, we all know about that folder.

Lightshot Hopper is an extension that allows you to quickly jump from the default prntscr.com page, where 
your screenshot can be previewed, to the direct link of the image, hosted on imgur. This allows you do avoid 
some annoying right clicking.
